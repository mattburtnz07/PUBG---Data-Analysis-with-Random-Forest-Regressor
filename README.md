# PUBG Data Analysis with XGBoost

This repository holds my submission for PUBG Finish Placement Prediction (Kernels Only) Kaggle competition.  
This goal of this competition is to predict the finishing place of a person playing PUBG using features such as the players kills, assists and distance travelled. For my submission I have used a Random Forest Regressor and achieved a Public Score of 0.04755 placing me around the middle of the field of entrants.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project involved heavy use of Pandas, a Python library for data analysis and manipulation.
